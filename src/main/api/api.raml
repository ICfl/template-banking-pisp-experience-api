  description: |
    Initiates payment to payee from consumer. Before transfer of funds can be processed, customer authentication and consent must occur. A nonce will be used to prevent replay attacks and inadvertent duplicate transfers.
    
    The payee information is provided to the API as a JWT token with the set of payment claims. The JWT token (https://jwt.io/introduction/) is signed with the client secret of the registered app to ensure that it is not tampered with.
    
    This endpoint finally redirects to the redirect_url provided as part of the inputs. The redirect_url should match the one registered by the client. It will return transaction_id and status.
